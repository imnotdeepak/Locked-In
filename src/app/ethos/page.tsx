            The world has far too many distractions. Our phones constantly
            pinging us with notifications, social media reminding us to check
            our feeds, ads bombarding us at every turn. It&apos;s far too much.
            That is why this exists. This is a simple web app that gives you a
            sense of direction. Get everything down, see what you need to do,
            and get it done. There are no distractions, no price to pay, no ads,
            no notifications, just you and what needs to get done. Take control
            of your life.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are 3 main parts to this web app. The first one is the daily
            page. This is where you put down your daily tasks. Maybe waking up
            every day at the same time, drinking enough water, getting enough
            sleep, getting enough water, working out, whatever it is, if
            it&apos;s a habit, put it down here. The second page is the todo
            page. This is in the form of a kanban board, so you can add tasks,
            drag and drop them into different columns, reorder them, and delete
            them. This is so you can see what work you need to do on the day to
            day, prioritze them based on order, and remove them when they are
            complete. The third page is a goals page, which allows you to not
            lose sight on where you want to be. It&apos;s always there, a
            constant reminder so you don&apos;t fall behind. There are both
            short term and long term goals for you to work towards.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reason why there is no history is because the past is the past.
            If you fall behind, it can be discouraging. Each day is a new day, a
            new chance to get things done. You don&apos;t need a constant
            reminder of your failures of the days prior, you should already know
            about them. And once you start getting things done, finishing your
            daily goals, getting all your work done, reaching your goals, you
            don&apos;t need a reminder of that either. You are the embodiment of
            your success.
