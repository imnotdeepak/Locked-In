            The world is way too distracted. Constantly checking our phones,
            jumping to check every single notification that appears in our
            lives, slowly scrolling all the time away. We're scrolling our lives
            away without even noticing. And when there's work to get done, it
            needs to get done. Here at Locked In, we believe that true
            productivity comes not from doing more, but from doing the right
            things with your focus. Attention spans are getting shorter and
            shorter. We need to get things done.

            We both know you're not going to get anything done if you're not
            focused. So, if you're clicking on this website, you need to
